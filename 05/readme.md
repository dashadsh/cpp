Nested classes, also known as inner classes, are classes defined within another class. They are like little "sub-classes" inside the main class, allowing you to group related functionality together. Nested classes have access to all members (public, protected, and private) of the enclosing class, which makes them useful for organizing and encapsulating certain functionalities.

For example, consider a class representing a car. Within the car class, you can define a nested class for the engine, another nested class for the wheels, and so on. Each nested class can have its own data members and member functions, specific to its functionality.

Here's a simplified example:

```cpp
class Car {
private:
    // Car data members

    class Engine {
    private:
        // Engine data members

    public:
        // Engine member functions
        void start() {
            // ...
        }
    };

    class Wheels {
    private:
        // Wheels data members

    public:
        // Wheels member functions
        void rotate() {
            // ...
        }
    };

public:
    // Car member functions

    void startCar() {
        Engine engine;
        engine.start();
    }

    void rotateWheels() {
        Wheels wheels;
        wheels.rotate();
    }
};
```

In this example, we have a `Car` class with nested classes `Engine` and `Wheels`. Each nested class has its own specific functionality related to the car. The `Car` class can create instances of the nested classes and use their member functions.

To use the nested classes from outside the `Car` class, we would need to access them using the scope resolution operator, like this:

```cpp
Car::Engine carEngine;
Car::Wheels carWheels;
```

Nested classes can be a powerful tool for organizing code and providing logical grouping within a class. They help maintain the encapsulation and abstraction of the main class while allowing you to break down complex functionality into smaller, manageable parts.

In C++, exceptions are like special alarms that the program can raise when something unexpected or erroneous happens. They provide a way to deal with these errors in a more organized and controlled manner.

Imagine you are a chef making a cake, and suddenly the oven catches fire. Instead of panicking and running around, you press a button to trigger the fire alarm. The alarm system takes over and guides everyone to safety, allowing firefighters to handle the fire. Exceptions work similarly in C++. When an error occurs, the program throws an exception, and the exception-handling system takes over, directing the program to a safe place where the error can be dealt with properly.

Here's a simple example to illustrate exceptions in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

double divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
    if (divisor == 0) {
        throw "Divide by zero exception";
    }

    return static_cast<double>(dividend) / divisor;
}

int main() {
    int dividend, divisor;
    std::cout << "Enter dividend: ";
    std::cin >> dividend;
    std::cout << "Enter divisor: ";
    std::cin >> divisor;

    try {
        double result = divide(dividend, divisor);
        std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    } catch (const char* errorMessage) {
        std::cout << "Exception caught: " << errorMessage << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a function `divide()` that takes two integers as input and returns their division as a double. However, if the `divisor` is zero, the function throws an exception with the message "Divide by zero exception."

In the `main()` function, we use a `try` block to call the `divide()` function. If an exception is thrown inside the `divide()` function, the program jumps to the `catch` block, which is like a safety net designed to handle the exception.

When you run the program and try to divide by zero, the `divide()` function will throw the exception, and the program will catch it in the `catch` block. It will then display the error message "Divide by zero exception."

Exceptions help your program recover from errors gracefully and provide valuable information about what went wrong. They allow you to handle error scenarios in a controlled manner without crashing the program. Additionally, C++ provides a set of standard exception classes through the `<stdexcept>` header, which can be used to handle common types of exceptions more effectively.

In Exercise 00, we are creating a nested class called `GradeTooHighException` inside the `Bureaucrat` class. This nested class inherits from the base class `std::exception`, and it overrides the `what()` function, which is defined in the `exception` header.

Here's the code snippet for Exercise 00:

```cpp
#include <exception>

class Bureaucrat {
public:
    class GradeTooHighException : public std::exception {
    public:
        virtual const char* what() const throw() {
            return "The Grade is too high, maximum grade achievable: 1";
        }
    };

    // Bureaucrat class members and functions...
};
```

In this code, we have defined the nested class `GradeTooHighException` inside the `Bureaucrat` class. It is derived from the `std::exception` base class. By overriding the `what()` function, we provide a custom error message that will be displayed when this exception is caught.

For Exercise 02, we are dealing with a situation where the `Bureaucrat` class has constant attributes. This means that these attributes cannot be modified once they are initialized. When defining the copy constructor and copy assignment operator (`operator=`), we cannot directly assign new values to these constant attributes.

Here's an example illustrating the situation:

```cpp
class Bureaucrat {
private:
    const int grade;

public:
    // Constructors and other member functions...

    // Copy constructor
    Bureaucrat(const Bureaucrat& other) : grade(other.grade) {
        // We can initialize the constant 'grade' attribute during construction.
        // But we cannot modify it after it's initialized.
    }

    // Copy assignment operator
    Bureaucrat& operator=(const Bureaucrat& other) {
        // We cannot modify the constant 'grade' attribute, so we don't need to do anything here.
        // The compiler-generated copy assignment operator will handle the non-const members.
        return *this;
    }
};
```

In the code snippet above, we have a `Bureaucrat` class with a constant attribute `grade`. In the copy constructor, we can initialize the constant attribute during construction, but we cannot modify it after it's initialized. Therefore, the copy assignment operator for this class doesn't need to do anything with the constant `grade` attribute, as the compiler-generated copy assignment operator will handle the non-const members.

This approach ensures that the constant attributes of the class remain unmodifiable throughout the lifetime of the object, providing const correctness and preventing unintended modifications.
