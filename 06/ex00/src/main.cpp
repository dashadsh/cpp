// For each exercise, 
// the type conversion must be solved using one specific type of casting. 
// Your choice will be checked during defense.

// Allowed functions : 
// Any function to convert from a string to an int, a float or a double. 
// This will help, but wonâ€™t do the whole job.

// he code should make use of static_cast when it's necessary to convert values, 
// but can rely on the compiler's implicit casts when they involve change from smaller data type
//  to a larger one

	// it allows us to use it as a utility w/o having to instantiate an object !!!

// did student use static_cast to convert values? 
// accepted to use of IMPLICIT CASTS for promotion casts only
