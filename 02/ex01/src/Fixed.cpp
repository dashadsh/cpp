// An overload of the insertion (Â«) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
// of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as parameter.
// This allows to directly use std::cout << someFixedObject to print the Fixed object in a meaningful way.
// 
// out << fixed.toFloat() - converts the Fixed object to a float using the toFloat() member function, 
// and then inserts that float into the output stream. 
// So, when you print a Fixed object, you see it as a floating-point number, which is easier to understand than the internal fixed-point representation.
// return out - returns the modified output stream, allowing for chaining of output operations. 
// This is why you can write something like std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl; - 
// each << operation returns the output stream, which is then used as the input for the next << operation.

// overloaded insertion operator (<<) is used multiple times in the main() function of:
// std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;
// std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;
// std::cout << "c is " << c << std::endl;
// std::cout << "d is " << d << std::endl;
// << operator is used to insert the Fixed objects (a, b, c, d) into the std::cout stream, 
// which is then printed to the console.
// << operator calls the overloaded operator<< function, which in turn calls the toFloat() method on the Fixed object 
// to convert it to a floating point value before it is printed.
// Without this overloaded operator<< function, it wouldn't be able to directly print Fixed objects using std::cout <<, and would instead have to manually call toFloat() or toInt() each time you wanted to print a Fixed object. So this operator overloading provides a convenient way to print Fixed objects.


// ------------------------------------- BIT SHIFTING ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bit shifting is an operation that you can perform on binary data. It shifts the bit values of a binary 
// number to the left or the right.

// Here are the two types of bit shifts:

// Left Shift (<<): 
// This operator shifts the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions. 
// Each shift to the left doubles the number, so it's equivalent to multiplying the number by 2. 
// For example, if we have the number 5 (which is 101 in binary), shifting it to the left by one position gives 1010, 
// which is the binary representation of 10:

// int number = 5;  // binary: 101
// number = number << 1;  // number now equals 10, binary: 1010

// Right Shift (>>): 
// This operator shifts the bits of the number to the right by the specified number of positions. 
// Each shift to the right halves the number, discarding the fractional part if the number is not even 
// (i.e., it performs a floor division by 2). 
// For example, if we have the number 10 (which is 1010 in binary), shifting it to the right by one position gives 101, 
// which is the binary representation of 5:

// int number = 10;  // binary: 1010
// number = number >> 1;  // number now equals 5, binary: 101

// In both cases, the vacant bit positions are filled differently depending on the type of shift. 
// In a left shift, the vacant bit positions on the right are filled with zeros.
// In a right shift, if the number is an unsigned number, the vacant positions on the left are filled with zeros. 
// If the number is a signed number, the vacant positions are filled with the sign bit (0 for positive and 1 for negative) 
// to preserve the sign of the number.

// Bit shifting is a very efficient operation because it takes significantly less processing time 
// than multiplication or division. 

// However, its usage is somewhat specialized and typically found in low-level programming, 
// algorithms involving binary data, or optimization efforts.
