### Canonical Form

In C++, the canonical form of a class refers to providing a standard set of member functions to ensure proper functionality and consistency. The four essential member functions in the canonical form are:

1. Constructor: Initializes the object when it is created. Constructors can have different forms, such as default constructors, parameterized constructors, copy constructors, etc.

2. Destructor: Cleans up and releases resources when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor is responsible for freeing any dynamically allocated memory and releasing any resources held by the object.

3. Copy Constructor: Creates a new object as a copy of an existing object. The copy constructor is called when you pass an object by value, return an object by value, or create a new object based on an existing object.

4. Copy Assignment Operator: Allows you to assign one object to another of the same type. The copy assignment operator is called when you use the assignment operator (`=`) to copy the contents of one object to another.

These four functions ensure proper object initialization, memory management, and data integrity when working with objects of a class.

#### Copy Constructor

The copy constructor takes an instance of the same class as an argument and creates a new instance with the same values for its member variables. It is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object. The copy constructor is often used when you pass or return objects by value or when you create a new object as a copy of an existing one.

Example of a copy constructor:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(int value) : data(value) {}

    // Copy Constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : data(other.data) {}

private:
    int data;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(42);       // Creates obj1 with value 42
    MyClass obj2(obj1);     // Creates obj2 as a copy of obj1 using the copy constructor
    MyClass obj3 = obj1;    // Same as above, creates obj3 as a copy of obj1
    return 0;
}
```

#### Copy Assignment Operator

The copy assignment operator (`operator=`) allows you to assign one object to another of the same type. It is called when you use the assignment operator (`=`) to copy the contents of one object to another.

Example of a copy assignment operator:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(int value) : data(value) {}

    // Copy Assignment Operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        data = other.data;
        return *this;
    }

private:
    int data;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(42);       // Creates obj1 with value 42
    MyClass obj2(24);       // Creates obj2 with value 24

    obj2 = obj1;            // Calls the copy assignment operator to copy obj1's value to obj2
    return 0;
}
```

In the copy assignment operator, you should follow the copy-and-swap idiom, which ensures exception safety and proper handling of self-assignment. You can implement the copy assignment operator using the same logic as the copy constructor to copy the data members from the source object to the destination object.

#### Floating-Point and Fixed-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers, such as `float` and `double`, represent real numbers with a varying number of digits to represent the fractional part. They follow the IEEE-754 standard and have a sign bit, an exponent, and a fraction.

Fixed-point numbers, on the other hand, use a fixed number of bits to represent both the integer and fractional parts of a number. The position of the binary point separates the integer and fractional parts, and the number of bits used for the fractional part is fixed.

Fixed-point numbers are often used in scenarios where the hardware or software does not support efficient floating-point arithmetic. They are typically more efficient for certain applications and can be used to represent decimal values with fixed precision.

#### Dummy Variable

The "dummy variable" in the context of operator overloading, specifically the post-increment operator (`operator++(int)`), is a parameter that serves as a marker to differentiate between the post-increment and pre-increment operators. The parameter itself is not used within the function implementation.

In C++, the post-increment operator has a unique signature that includes an integer parameter with a value of 0. This parameter is not used within the function but is essential for the compiler to differentiate between the pre-increment and post-increment operators.

#### Storage Classes

Storage classes in C++ specify the scope, lifetime, and visibility of variables and functions. The common storage classes are `auto`, `static`, `register`, `extern`, and `mutable`. The use of these storage classes depends on the specific needs of the program and the desired behavior of the variables or functions.

For example, the `static` storage class is often used to create variables with static duration, which means they retain their values across function calls and have a lifetime that extends throughout the program's execution.

#### Example (ex02)

In the example provided (ex02), the operations on `Fixed` numbers should generally be performed on their floating-point equivalents. This is because performing arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers can be more convenient and accurate.

For example, when overloading the `+` operator for `Fixed`, you can first convert the `Fixed` objects to floating-point numbers, perform the addition, and then convert the result back to a `Fixed` object. This approach ensures accurate arithmetic calculations and better handling of fractional parts.

Additionally, when implementing pre-increment and post-increment operators (`++`), it's essential to perform the operations directly on the raw bits of the `Fixed` object to increase or decrease the value by the smallest representable epsilon. In this case, you should not convert to floating-point format before performing the increment or decrement.

Overall, using floating-point representation for arithmetic operations and raw bits for pre/post-increment and decrement operations will provide the most accurate and efficient behavior for the `Fixed` class.
